### Portfolio website

This Website was built to showcase some of the projects I built both during my time on the Code Institute course and after.

It well be regularly updated with newer projects that I build while I continue to learn new technologies such as Java and the React framework.

This SPA was built using:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * JQuery
 * EmailJS
 * Animate.css
 * FontAwesome
